# HEAT PUMP CALCULATOR

## Set up environment

```bash
# from root dir of repo
cd client/ ; npm install
cd ../server/ ; npm install
```

## Run the application

Either two terminals or good bash-fu is needed cause there's two separate
applications. Start both terminals in the root of the repo.

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd server/
npm start
```

```bash
# Terminal 2
cd client/
npm start
```
